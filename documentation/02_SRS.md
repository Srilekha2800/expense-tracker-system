# 1. Introduction

The Expense Tracker System is a responsive web application developed to help users efficiently manage their personal financial transactions. The application enables users to record income and expenses, monitor savings, and analyze spending patterns through an intuitive dashboard and detailed financial reports.

The first version of the application focuses on frontend development using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Future versions will integrate a Java-based Spring Boot backend and a MySQL database to enable secure user authentication, persistent storage of financial data, and dynamic report generation.

---

# 2. Purpose

The purpose of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is to define the functional and non-functional requirements of the Expense Tracker System.

This document serves as a blueprint for designing, developing, testing, maintaining, and enhancing the application throughout its software development lifecycle.
